I was born in Ames, Iowa, in 1986. I attended the University of Missouri in 2004, from which I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 2009. After a one year hiatus tutoring, I returned, and received a Master of Arts degree in philosophy in 2012. I then transferred to the University of Missouri School of Engineering to study computer science under the supervision of Dr. Bill Harrison, and received a Master of Science in 2016. I graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 2019.

In 2013, I worked as an intern under Dr. Zac Ernst at a company called Adventur.es, in Columbia, Missouri. Zac taught me to program in Python, and introduced me to machine learning and automated theorem proving. In 2014, I interned for NASA as a Langley Aerospace Research Student Scholar, under the supervision of Dr. Alwyn Goodloe. In 2016, I began focusing on the theory and application of epistemic logic under the doctoral supervision of Dr. Rohit Chadha.

I married Maggie in 2014, and in 2018 we had our amazing daughter, Ellie.
